# Data_Cleaning_and_Advanced_Formatting

The document contains two sheets: "Raw Data" and "Cleaned & Formatting". I will now inspect the contents of each sheet to understand the context and generate a comprehensive project explanation.The project appears to involve data cleaning and advanced formatting for product inventory management. Here's a detailed overview of each sheet and its purpose:

Sheet Descriptions:
Raw Data:

Contains unprocessed product data, including:
Product Code, Name, Category, Price, Stock, and Description fields.
Some data points exhibit errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.
Potential issues include:
Mixed category spellings (e.g., "ElecTronics" vs. "Electronics").
Negative stock values.
Unnecessary empty rows and columns.
Cleaned & Formatting:

Provides a structured and cleaned dataset.
Key improvements include:
Standardized category names.
Corrected stock values or flagged negative entries.
Use of data validation, conditional formatting, and highlighting for effective visualization.
Removal of unnecessary columns and rows.
